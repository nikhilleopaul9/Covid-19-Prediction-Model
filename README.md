# Covid-19 Prediction Model
Covid-19 Prediction Model using various Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models.
The goal of this repository is to create a standardized set of data on forecasts from teams making projections of cumulative and incident deaths and confirmed cases due to COVID-19 in the world.
# Overview
**Data:** The John Hopkins University Dataset has been used for the modeling which has been directly extracted the Github repository CSSEGISandData.

Proper **EDA** has been performed for the total number of cases, deaths and recoveries followed by Country wise EDA.

##**Machine Learning Algorithms Used: ARIMA, Polynomial Regression, Holt's Linear Trend Model,Facebook Prophet, Kalman Filter.**

##**Deep Learning Models Used: DNN, Vanilla LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, CNN LSTM.**
